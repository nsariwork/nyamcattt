        <h2>GENERAL</h2>

        <p>i. These terms are for NON-COMMERCIAL commission only. Client may NOT use commissioned artwork to reproduce and/or sell for profit, physically or digitally. If you'd like to hire me for commercial purposes, please email me at nsari.contact (at) gmail . com</p>

        <p>iv. My turnaround ranges from 2 weeks to 8 weeks AFTER payment is made, depending on how many projects I'm working on and the complexity of the piece. It's possible to take longer than that, in that case, it will be communicated to client through email. If client would like to know the progress of their commissioned artwork within the 8 weeks, please consult the excel sheet. If you'd like a faster turnaround, please say so in the form. I may be able to deliver faster for an extra fee.</p>

        <h2>COMMERCIAL RIGHTS</h2>

        <p>i. I retain the rights to display commissioned artwork on my public online personal art galleries. If client would like to keep a commissioned artwork from public spaces for certain amount of time (i.e. a birthday surprise gift for someone else), please let me know so I don't spoil it.</p>

        <h2>EDITS</h2>

        <p>i. Edits and changes are encouraged to be requested after a rough sketch is sent and before the payments are made.</p>
